Originally from South Sulawesi, Indonesia, I've always been inspired to explore the worldâ€”both its physical and technological landscapes. My journey into computers and programming began at ITS Surabaya, where I discovered my interest in tech.

Currently, I am a Senior Solution Consultant at New Relic, specializing in observability platforms. This role allows me to help businesses understand their data and make informed decisions.

I have extensive experience in the banking industry, working with languages like Java and Go, and technologies including AS/400 and core banking solutions. My work has spanned several critical areas such as ESB and CRM implementations.
